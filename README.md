Erica Synths DIY Eurorack Modules
=================================

As Erica Synths discontinues its legacy DIY eurorack projects, we decided to make them open-source. We created Gerber files for PCB-made front panels and did slight changes in a module design in order to get rid of custom and rare components, still some modules require rare ICs which are available on www.ericasynths.lv. Each folder contains complete information and files to build a module: schematics, Gerber files for a front panel, Gerber files for PCBs, BOMs, component placement with values and designators and assembly manuals (please, note that some manuals are designed for older module versions).
By making these projects opensource, Erica Synths is ok, if the third parties use them for personal, educational or commercial purposes.
Erica Synths will not provide any support for these projects, please, refer to forums (www.muffwiggler.com) for information on build nuances, troubleshooting, part availability or alternatives.
